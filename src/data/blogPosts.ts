    excerpt:
      "Learn how this starter template wires together Vite, Backbone, Handlebars, jQuery, and Bootstrap to build small SPAs.",
    content: `
      <p>
        This starter template is designed to give you a modern build setup for
        classic Backbone applications. Vite handles fast bundling and HMR,
        while Backbone keeps your app structure simple and understandable.
      </p>
      <p>
        The core ideas are:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Use <strong>Backbone.Router</strong> for hash-based navigation.</li>
        <li>Render views with <strong>Backbone.View</strong> and <strong>Handlebars</strong> templates.</li>
        <li>Style everything quickly with <strong>Bootstrap 5</strong> and <strong>Bootstrap Icons</strong>.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        You can extend this blog with more posts, or replace it with your own
        content loaded from an API.

      "A quick overview of how to keep your Backbone views small and reusable, while using Handlebars for layout.",
    content: `
      <p>
        In this starter, each page is represented by a dedicated
        <code>Backbone.View</code> class under <code>src/views</code>.
        Handlebars templates are defined as template strings and compiled once.
      </p>
      <p>
        This separation makes it easy to:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Reuse views in different routes.</li>
        <li>Swap templates without changing view logic.</li>
        <li>Test view behavior in isolation.</li>

      "Use Backbone.Router to keep your navigation in sync with the URL, including simple blog routes.",
    content: `
      <p>
        Backbone.Router gives you a light-weight way to handle navigation in
        small single-page applications. Routes map URL fragments to handler
        functions that show or hide views.
      </p>
      <p>
        In this example blog, routes such as
        <code>#blog</code> and <code>#blog/:slug</code> are used to show the
        blog index and individual posts.

        Collections are ordered sets of models with helpful APIs for filtering,
        sorting, and syncing with a server.

        In this starter, both the home view and the blog use collections to
